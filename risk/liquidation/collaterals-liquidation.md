# Collaterals liquidation

When your HF is close to 1.0, borrowers are supposed to repay some money to keep the HF health.

If borrowers don't repay the money, the collaterals may risk of been liquidated by anyone to start the liquidation.

Borrowers are supposed to get attention to the floor price of the collaterals in different exchange platform.

If on-chain auction for the collateral started, borrower still have 24 hours to repay loan and some fine to end the auction.
