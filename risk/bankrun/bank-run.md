# Bank run

All the assets sharing the liquidity in the pool are carefully selected by the Bitty team with full risk estimated.

But still we can't make sure that bank run will not happen when some of the assets get short term price drop a lot as black swan event.

When bank run happens, money suppliers can't withdraw the money until the money supply be back.

The supply interests will be high when reserves are not enough like 100% to attract more people deposit the money back to the protocol if they are confident that the price will be back after panic.

If the price don't get back and the liquidation is not finished by the liquidators, Bitty will use treasury to cover that lost.

The treasury will become more and more by the revenue generated from the protocol, peer-to-pool lending business it that how to provide the best lending experience with revenue generated but avoid of being too aggressive that bad debts generated over the treasury.
