# Platform

* Frontend hack risk, if our frontend is hacked, you may lose assets while signing your wallet, this is all the web3 platform risk from web3. Double check before you sign in your wallet that make sure you know what you are doing while using your wallet.
* Backend hack risk, if our backend multi-sig service & third party partner are both hacked, you may lose your deposits or collaterals, see the more details [here](../faq/is-that-my-assets-safe.md).&#x20;
