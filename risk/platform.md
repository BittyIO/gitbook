# Platform

In general, if a platform provides a valuable service that users genuinely need, an innovative team is less likely to take risks by engaging in malicious activities to steal users' funds. The likelihood of such behavior diminishes further if the team is subject to due diligence by venture capital investors and has a vested interest in maintaining their reputation and family security.

However, itâ€™s important to know that risks can never be entirely eliminated, whether dealing with a non-upgradable smart contract or a Bitcoin multi-sig script.

#### Frontend Hack Risk

If Bitty's frontend is compromised, you could risk losing your wallet assets while signing transactions. To mitigate this, we use GitHub's Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure that no new frontend code can be published without team permission. **PS: Always double-check before signing any transactions to confirm that you know what you are doing.**

#### Backend Hack Risk

If the AEE cloud platform we use is hacked, you may risk losing your supplied assets. If both Bitty and our third-party partners are compromised, you could lose your ordinals. For more details on these risks, please refer to [here](../faq/are-my-assets-safe.md).

The longer the platform run, and the more money in the protocol, the more trust platform earned from the market, we as part of the team, had been running BendDAO for safe 800+ days.
