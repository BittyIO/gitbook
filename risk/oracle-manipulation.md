# Oracle manipulation

We use price data from centralized exchange like Binance & decentralized exchange platform like MagicEden for BRC20/Runes & Ordinals.

Our oracle algorithm is not exposed, and before any decentralized service like chainlink to have a stable oracle service on Bitcoin, we will keep the oracle maintained by bitty for taking responsibility of our users.

On Bitcoin, since blocking time is 10 mins average:

* attacking lending service by making the price low to liquidate borrowers' assets is harder than other chains like Ethereum, cos the attackers need keep the price low longer, which make other buyers to buy them out easier.
* attacking lending service by making the price high to rug the money in the pool is harder, cos lending just support LTV like 30% - 50%, the attackers need a lot of money to keep the price of the assets higher than 200% - 300%+ to make the attack profitable.

That's how bitcoin keep a longer block time to have a more secure ledger, and that's how people feeling safe to save value on Bitcoin and how we feel safe to build on Bitcoin.
