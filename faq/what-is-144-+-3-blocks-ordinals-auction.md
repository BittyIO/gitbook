# What is 144 + 3 blocks ordinals auction?

The 144 + 3 block auction system is designed for the liquidation of ordinals through an on-chain auction. The 144 blocks roughly equate to 24 hours (6 blocks per hour), ensuring that ordinals owners wonâ€™t lose their assets unexpectedly due to a brief absence, such as during sleep or travel. However, once the auction starts, **ordinals owners can only end the auction within the 144 blocks by redeem,** **the additional 3 blocks do not provide liquidation protection for them.**

The +3 blocks to make sure that the ordinals owner can sell their collateral on-chain for a fair price to get the value back after repaying debt, each higher bid should be 1% more than last highest bid.

#### Case 1:

* David borrowed 0.1 BTC against his ordinals when the floor price of his ordinals was 0.2 BTC.
* David unable to repay the loan, the floor price drops to make his loan health factor lower than 1.
* Alice's success started the auction by first bidding David's ordinals at block height #1.
* Bob bided higher at block height #51, Alice get her bid money back in Bob's transaction.

#### Why Use Block Height Instead of Timestamp?

We prefer block height over timestamps for auction management to mitigate risks associated with varying block times. Occasionally, Bitcoin can produce two blocks simultaneously, and the longest interval between two blocks can be up to two hours. However, the chance of three blocks being generated at the same time is exceedingly low.

Using block height ensures that users can submit auction transactions with higher gas fees in the mempool, reducing the reliance on luck regarding block timing and minimizing advantages for mining pools that might attempt to exploit auctions.
