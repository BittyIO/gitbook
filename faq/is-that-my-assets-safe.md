# Is that my assets safe?

In general, both exchange and lending are build on multi-sig, so the security of multi-sig is the most important thing of service on bitcoin.

So, we need to answer two key questions:

* May that platform be evil as part of the multi-sig?
  * The platform is doing a positive-sum game business which create value instead of stealing money from customers.
  * The platform should be run by a company with due-diligence jobs done by VC, which make sure that founders and his team will be punished if they do evil thing.
* How the platform manage the platform part of multi-sig?
  * using MPC service to manage the keys
  * using [AWS ANE](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/nitro-enclaves/) to manage the keys

The team should provide the best user experience product with the max decentralized techs being used to keep the platform safe, that's how they win the market.
