# Why Bitty?

On Ethereum, FT users use peer-to-pool services like AAVE and Compound to borrow money, while NFT users use services like BendDAO. While Bitcoiners can use Liquidium as a peer-to-peer service, we want to complete the last piece of the Bitcoin ecosystem by a peer-to-pool lending service. That’s why we started Bitty, aiming to provide the best lending service on Bitcoin for ordinals, BRC20, and Runes assets holders—creating an all-in-one lending solution for Bitcoin.

**What is peer-to-pool lending**

Peer-to-pool lending is a product that users can participate as suppliers or borrowers.&#x20;

Suppliers provide liquidity to the market by the product to earn interests, while borrowers are able to borrow money instantly by over-collateralised assets, both of them don't need to match each other, they supply/borrow money to/from the platform.

**Why peer-to-pool lending**

While in the early age of a market, people using peer-to-peer service like what AAVE was ETHLend before, and what NFTFi was for NFT, after the assets become more stable like bitcoin, Ethereum, CryptoPunks, BAYC, the more efficient lending service is required by the market to let borrowers can get loan instantly and make suppliers and liquidators work as different roles.&#x20;

That's why we see protocol like AAVE, Compound are dominating the lending business.

**How peer-to-pool lending win the market**

Borrowers are the demand from the market, the revenue source of the product, peer-to-pool lending is way more friendly for the borrowers, that's why peer-to-pool lending win the market.
