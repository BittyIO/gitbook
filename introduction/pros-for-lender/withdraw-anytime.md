# Withdraw money anytime

Lenders can withdraw money in the lending pool anytime as long as enough money in the pool.

Since the pool will change interests block by block from supply/demand data in the pool, there will be enough money for the lenders to withdraw money anytime if no [bank run](../../risk/bankrun/bank-run.md).
