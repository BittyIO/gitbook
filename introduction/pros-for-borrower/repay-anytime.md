# Repay money anytime

Borrowers can repay the money anytime they want as long as the collaterals not been liquidated.

This is very important for the borrowers to use borrowed money to invest anywhere for a long enough time.

For example:

* Alice bought an ordinals at floor price which is 0.2btc
* Alice use Bitty to borrow 0.1btc, then she use that 0.1btc to buy some other assets
* After 12 days, the ordinals floor price is 0.23btc which means Alice don't need to repay any money which she should have to sold the assets she bought using that 0.1btc to repay the money she borrowed if she is using a peer-to-peer lending service for a 12 days fixed instead
