# Get value from auction (ordinals)

If your ordinals get liquidated, it's fully on-chain auction for 144 blocks, the highest bid win the auction and you will get money after repaying the loan.

It's very important if your ordinals are grails, cos you won't get liquidated by floor price like in peer-to-peer lending service.

For example:

* Alice bought a grail NodeMonke at 0.3 btc when floor price was 0.2btc
* Alice borrowed 0.1btc from Bitty by 50% LTV of floor price 0.2btc
* Alice get liquidated cos she can't repay the loan
* After auction finished, auction winner bid for 0.27btc for that grail NodeMonke
* Alice get 0.27 - 0.1 = 0.17btc back after the auction which she will never get if she used a peer-to-peer service
