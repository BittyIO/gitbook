# Get value from liquidation (ordinals)

If your ordinals get liquidated, it's fully on-chain auction for 24 hours, the highest bid win the auction and you will get money after repaying the loan.

It's very important if your ordinals are grails, cos you won't get liquidated by floor price like in peer-to-peer lending service.
