# Get value from the auctions (ordinals)

If your ordinals get liquidated, it's fully on-chain auction for [144 + 3](../../faq/what-is-144-+-3-blocks-ordinals-auction.md) blocks, the highest bid win the auction and you will get money after repaying the loan.

It's very important if your ordinals are grails, because you won't get liquidated by floor price like in peer-to-peer lending service.

For example:

* `Alice bought a grail ordinals at 0.3 BTC when floor price was 0.2 BTC`
* `Alice borrowed 0.1 BTC from Bitty by 50% LTV of floor price 0.2 BTC`
* `Alice get liquidated cos she can't repay the loan`
* `After auction finished, auction winner bid for 0.27 BTC for that grail ordinals`
* `Alice get 0.27 - 0.1 = 0.17 BTC back after the auction which she will never get if she used a peer-to-peer service`
