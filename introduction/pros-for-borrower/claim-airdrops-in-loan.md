# Claim airdrops in loans (Ordinals)

In a peer-to-pool lending, the ownership of ordinals are borrowers before the collaterals get auctioned.

So the borrowers can claim any airdrop assets in their lending address generated by the platform by them co-signed with the platform right after the assets airdropped.

This is very important for the borrowers because the airdrop assets maybe worthless after user repay the loan to claim it in a peer-to-peer lending service.
