# Borrow money instantly

Borrowers can get the loan instantly instead of waiting the lender to match the loan.

This is very important for the borrowers cos sometimes they need to wait for hours to days to match their loans.

For example:

* `Alice bought an ordinals at 0.2btc`&#x20;
* `Alice using a peer-to-peer lending to borrow 0.1btc when the floor price of her ordinals is stable in 2 hours`
* `Alice repaid the loan when she finished using the money after 10 days`
* `Alice want to borrow the money again when the floor price of the ordinals is dropping`&#x20;
* `Alice can't match the loan in two days because the floor price is keep dropping that the lenders don't want to lend out the money when the floor price is dropping to make borrowers more likely to default the loan`

And for sure as borrower you won't get error like the offers invalid or the initial offer replaced by other loans because there is enough money in the pool for you.
