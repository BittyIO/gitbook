# Claim airdrops in loans (Ordinals)

In a peer-to-pool lending model, borrowers retain ownership of their ordinals until the collateral is auctioned. This means borrowers can claim any airdropped assets to their lending address generated by the platform, co-signed with the platform, immediately after the airdrop occurs.

This feature is crucial for borrowers, as airdropped assets may lose value by the time they repay the loan and attempt to claim them in a peer-to-peer lending service.
