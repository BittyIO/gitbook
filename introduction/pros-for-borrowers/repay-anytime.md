# Repay money anytime

Borrowers can repay the money anytime they want as long as the [Health Factor](../../faq/what-is-health-factor.md) of the loan is above 1.

This is very important for the borrowers to use borrowed money to invest anywhere for a long enough time.

Example for Ordinals:

* `Alice bought an ordinals at floor price 0.2 BTC`
* `Alice use a peer-to-peer service to borrow 0.1 BTC, then she use that 0.1 BTC to buy assets "A"`
* `After 12 days, the ordinals floor price is 0.23 BTC but Alice still need to sold some of the "A" she bought and repaid to repay that loan`
* `If Alice used a peer-to-pool service, she don't need to sell "A" to repay that loan that she won't miss any value up by "A"`

Example for BRC20/Runes:

* `Alice bought 10k USD BRC20 token`
* `Alice use a peer-to-peer service to borrow 5k USD StableCoin, then she use that 5K StableCoin to buy assets "A"`
* `After 10 days, the BRC20 token price is up 10% but Alice still need to sold some of the "A" she bought and repaid to repay that loan`
* `If Alice used a peer-to-pool service, she don't need to sell "A" to repay that loan that she won't miss any value up by "A"`

Since the assets been listed in a peer-to-pool lending service are bluechips and had good liquidity in DEX/CEX, so the borrowers can feel free to use the borrowed money as long as they want, it's a huge advantage comparing to fixed-peroid peer-to-peer lending service.
